# Welcome to The HKautoFarmProject!

## What is the HKautoFarmProject?

In simple terms, the HKautoFarmProject is an automated water farm that uses the <a href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/products/lego-mindstorms-education-ev3-intelligent-brick/45500">Lego Mindstorms EV3 brick</a> and a Lego Mindstorms EV3 Motor in order to dispense water from a water tank into a cup in order to hydrate the plant in the cup automatically with no human involvement. Built into the water tank there is a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15663">Sparkfun Thing Plus ESP32 Wroom</a> board and the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/19096">SparkFun Environmental Sensor - BME688 (Qwiic)</a> to take humidity readings from the water tank which dispenses water directly to the plant. 

## The purpose of the project:

The purpose of the project is to create a foundation on how future DIY homemade autofarms can be created using the items around your home. These autofarms will help increase the amount of greenery in our world as the plant is automatically maintained by automated robotic devices.
