# Welcome to The HKautoFarmProject!

## What is the HKautoFarmProject?

In simple terms, the HKautoFarmProject is an automated water farm that uses the <a href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/products/lego-mindstorms-education-ev3-intelligent-brick/45500">Lego Mindstorms EV3 brick</a> and a Lego Mindstorms EV3 Motor in order to dispense water from a water tank into a cup in order to hydrate the plant in the cup automatically with no human involvement. Built into the water tank there is a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15663">Sparkfun Thing Plus ESP32 Wroom board</a> and the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/19096">SparkFun Environmental Sensor - BME688 (Qwiic)</a> to take humidity readings from the water tank which dispenses water directly to the plant. 

## The purpose of the project:

The purpose of the project is to create a foundation on how future DIY homemade autofarms can be created using the items around your home. These autofarms will help increase the amount of greenery in our world as the plant is automatically maintained by automated robotic devices.


## How it was developed:

The development of the HKautoFarmProject was fairly simple. We used a demo example code from a custom Sparkfun environmental sensor library and got readings of the humidity of our dispenser/tank. In order to get the actual dispenser contraption to work automatically, we had to develop a Lego Mindstorms EV3 program which ran the motor in order to dispense water into the plant's pot. The Lego Mindstorms Code is called HKProject.lmsp and can be found in this Github repository in the files section up above.

## Technology used in this project:

### Sparkfun Products:
For this project we mainly used two Sparkfun products. Number one is the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15663">Sparkfun Thing Plus</a> and number two is the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/19096">SparkFun Environmental Sensor</a>. These devices were used in order to read the humidity values and print them to the monitor screen.

### Lego Products:
For this project we used the <a href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/products/lego-mindstorms-education-ev3-intelligent-brick/45500">Lego Mindstorms EV3 brick</a> and a Lego Mindstorms EV3 motor (could not find the link for reference to original website). These electronics were used to open and close the water dispenser.
